Many of us have started walking more since the start of COVID and stay-at-home mandates. Many of us have also moved to a new city. What if there was an app that helped you explore a new city or any city through a guided walking tour? This is the firs titeraiton of that applicationâ€” an interactive map of few select murals in Baltimore, Maryland.
