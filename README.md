Since the start of COVID many people started walking more and many moved to new cities. However, walks get boring after a while espeically if you are not familiar with all the sights a new city has to offer. What if there was an app that easily allowed you to explore a new city while also getting in your steps? This is the firs iteration of that applicationâ€” an interactive map that helps walkers find routes where there is publicly availble artwork in the city of their choice.
