# About
Since the start of COVID many people moved to new cities and started walking more. However, walks get boring after a while especially if you are not familiar with all the sights a new city has to offer. What if there was an app that easily allowed you to explore a new city while also getting in your daily steps? This is the first iteration of that applicationâ€” an interactive map intended to help walkers find routes where there is publicly viewable art along the way.
